The three features and how they will be tested. 

Watchlist: A specific scenario would be when the user is adding a stock to the watchlist. The data will be the symbol of the
stock as well as the username of the user so it can be added to their watchlist. The test data will be a temporary user and
an arbitrary company, such as Apple. It will be done on the local system on one/all of the project member's laptops. 
The results should be that the stock would be added to the watchlist page, and it is in the database with all of the data recorded.


Navbar: This navbar will be used to navigate the different pages, such as the watchlist to the browse menu. The user activity will
be if the user needs to access a different page than the current one, then they would use the navbar. There will be no data being used
as this feature does not directly affect the user, and will remain static across all user expierences. The result of this test will be
that the user can navigate to different pages successfully without running into issues in the background. 

About Page: The about page will be used to inform the users about the company. The data that will be used within this test will be the 
company stock symbol because that is what is needed to get the description about the company. It will be tested on the local system of
one/all of the project member's laptops. The result will be either a new page or a little pop-up giving a description about the company.
