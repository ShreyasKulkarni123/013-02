4/2/2024 Scrum meeting

This week is implementation of the unit test

Have different variety of API's implementation this week

Divide the workload evenly

Focus on the directory structure, example in project overview, will help with changes and where to add the code

Have atleast one feature done this week, so she can leave feedback. Needs to see a basic framework

Advice: Work on back end and front end simultaneously so we arent wating for anything

Focus on picking up tasks from the board and getting the login and register page done
and one basic functinality and work on unit tests, 2 of them are on the login api
Write another two unit tests for an api thats not for login/register

By next week, have something that she can see

Have the unit tests done by next Tuesday so she can see the base features and stuff
